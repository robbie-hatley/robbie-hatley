# Languages I Program In:

My favorite language to program in, by far, is Perl. I especially like what's been done in the last few stable versions (5.36, 5.38, 5.40) as they add some features which I think should have been put in the language decades ago (eg, signatures and logical xor).

I can also program fluently in C, C++, Arduino, Sed, Awk, and AutoIt3.

I have a smattering of experience in Python and Raku, though I'm rusty at those.

Languages I'd like to learn in the future include Rust and Lisp.
