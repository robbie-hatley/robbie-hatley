# About Robbie Hatley:

## Welcome:

Greetings, visitors to my Github profile. As you've probably surmised by now, my name is "Robbie Hatley" and my GitHub user-id is "robbie-hatley". I am also known by many other monikers in other forums, including "robbie-hatley" (especially in programming and computer circles), "LoneWolfiNTj", "LagrangeL4", "Silly Salty Squiggleswirl", "Arlen Moondreamer", and others.

## Location:

My location is in Midway City, Orange County, southern California, USA, Earth, Sol System, Milky Way Galaxy, Virgo Cluster, Laniakea Supercluster. (It's important to know where one is in this universe.)

## Interests:

My interests and hobbies are many and varied: Computers, programming, The Internet, conversing in Internet forums, watching YouTube videos, online shopping, reading, writing, mathematics, the physical sciences, philosophy, psychology, music (both listening and composing), physical activity (walking, running, cycling, hiking), travel, photography, etc, etc, etc.

## Professions:

My professions are "computer programmer" and "electronics engineer".

## Identification:
However, I don't identify myself by my professions, because they are just what I _do_, not what I _am_. Nor do I identify myself by sex, religion, race, or politics. I'm just identify myself as "Robbie Hatley, a human".

## Hot Buttons:

Speaking of "sex, religion, race, or politics", while I do realize that one is not supposed to bring those 4 topics up in public, I always do anyway, because at age 65 I'm sick of walking on eggshells. So for what it's worth, here are my attitudes on those 4 topics: Sex: I don't judge people by their sexual orientation or sexual identification; that's their business, not mine. Religion: I am atheist; I think religions are all fantasies and should not be taken literally. Race: Does not exist; all humans originated in Africa, so we're all Black African Negros whether we like it or not; so let's just call ourselves "humans" and treat each other equally, please. Politics: I'm a libertarian/socialist blend; I think governments should allow people maximum liberties and rights feasible, but I also think governments should collect taxes and enact safety nets.

# Languages I Program In:

My favorite computer programming language to program in, by far, is Perl. I especially like what's been done in the last few stable versions (5.36, 5.38, 5.40) as they add some features which I think should have been put in the language decades ago (eg, signatures and logical xor).

I can also program fluently in C, C++, Arduino, Sed, Awk, and AutoIt3.

I have a smattering of experience in Python and Raku, though I'm rusty at those.

Languages I'd like to learn in the future include Rust and Lisp.
